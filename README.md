Abstract:

The soft decision-making methods are used efficiently to cope with some problems containing uncertainty. Recently, some of them have been configured by 
Enginoğlu and Memiş via fuzzy parameterized fuzzy soft matrices (fpfs-matrices), faithfully to the original, because a more general form is needed for 
the methods in the event that the parameters or objects have uncertainty. In this study, we consider three configured methods therein, denoted by MRB02, 
CCE10 and CCE11. We then apply these methods to a decision-making problem in image denoising. Finally, we discuss the need for further research.
